# Suicide Rate Analysis, Visualization, & Predictive Modeling

This repository presents a comprehensive data science project focused on understanding and predicting global suicide rates. It encompasses detailed exploratory data analysis, insightful visualizations, and the application of various machine learning models to identify patterns and forecast suicide numbers.

## üìä Project Overview

This project delves into a historical dataset of global suicide rates to uncover underlying trends and develop predictive capabilities. It serves as a strong demonstration of an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preparation and exploratory analysis to advanced machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## üéØ Objectives

* **Dataset Understanding & Preparation**: Gain a deep understanding of the suicide rate dataset (covering demographics, socio-economic factors, etc.) and prepare it for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify key trends, patterns, and correlations within the data through statistical analysis and compelling visualizations.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting suicide numbers based on relevant features.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Rigorously assess the performance of implemented models using appropriate metrics.
* **Insight Generation**: Derive actionable insights into factors influencing suicide rates globally.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset on global suicide rates spanning from 1985 to 2016. It includes variables such as country, year, age group, sex, population, GDP per capita, and Human Development Index (HDI).

* **Dataset File**: `SuicideData.csv`

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Analysis Steps

The project followed a structured data science methodology:

1.  **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**: Loaded the dataset into a suitable analytical environment (e.g., Pandas DataFrame in Python). Performed initial checks for data types, missing values, and unique entries to understand the dataset's structure and quality.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, standardized data formats, and performed necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in-depth statistical analysis and generated various visualizations to explore relationships, distributions, and trends.
5.  **Predictive Modeling**: Applied various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks to predict suicide numbers.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the performance and robustness of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
